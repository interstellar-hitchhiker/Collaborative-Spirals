Collaborative Spirals

Welcome to Collaborative Spirals, an interactive visualization inspired by the concept of "Reflection-in-action" by Donald Schön. This project demonstrates a dynamic and artistic representation of reflective practice, using spirals and text to illustrate the continuous process of experimentation and self-correction.

Description

In this visualization, two spirals evolve and intersect while a series of reflective quotes are displayed in a pulsating manner. The project is built using the p5.js library, which makes it easy to create interactive graphics.

Features
Dynamic Spirals: Two spirals grow and rotate, creating intricate patterns.
Interactive Text: Quotes from Donald Schön's "Reflection-in-action" appear with a pulsating effect.
Collision Detection: The spirals change when they intersect, highlighting the point of intersection.
